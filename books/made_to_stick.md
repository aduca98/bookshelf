# Made to stick by Chip and Dan Heath

- Throughout the book, each section ends with something leading into the next section. Ex. "BLANK is a problem. Silverman came up with a solution" and then goes in to next paragraph. Flows very nicely.

- "a medium sized popcorn contains more artery clogging grease than a bacon egg and cheese breakfast, big mac and fries, and a steak dinner... combined" good shock / wow. Also super visual.

- Some good qualities of stories:

  1. an unexpected danger in a common activity (ex. razer blades in halloween candy)
  2. simple action (ex. examine the kids candy)
  3. vivid concrete images
  4. tap into emotion (fear for Halloween candy, disgust for movie popcorn)

- There is no formula for a sticky idea. But the more of these things you include the higher liklihood of it being sticky.

- Constantly be looking for ideas with natural talent

### Key concepts:

- Simple: proverbs are great (simple and profound)
- Unexpectedness: generate interest and curiosity (ex. popcorn have more grease). You can do this by opening gaps and closing them
- Concrete: full of visuals, concrete images.
- Credibility: statistics don't really work (more ex. later, ex. no stats on economy slowing down. ask people 'are you better off than you were 4 years ago?')
- Emotions: make them feel something. tip: focus on individual not a group (ex. charity works better that way). we are wired to feel things for people, not abstractions.
- Stories: they are like simulators, you can follow along (Storyworthy is a good book for this)

- Tappers and listeners: people tap a rhythm and listeners have to guess. Study at Stanford. The tappers always thought the listeners would understand more than they did. This is the "Curse of Knowledge" you know the answer so you expect others to know it to.

- 89% of award winning ads can be classified by templates (like the ones we are going over). Most related to unexpectedness.

- "All happy families resemble each other, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" - Tolstoy. Same is true in businesses and ads.

### Concept 1: Simple

- "No plan survives contact with the enemy" - common military expression

- Top of every order is: specify plans goal, and desired end-state. Allow improve on the details.

- Figure out the "Commanders Intent" - ask yourself "if we do nothing else during tomorrow's mission, we must \_\_\_\_". Should have a concrete answer.

- Southwest, we are "The LOW cost airline" everything stems from that. Is a framework that helps everyone but allows them to improvise the details.

- Don't bury the lead, first sentence is most important and each sentence after is decreasing importance. This is an "inverted pyramid". Origin of this is Civil War bc military telegraphs could cut off at any moment.

- Exercise: be a wartime reporter before you write put the top idea first

- "If you say three things, you don't say anything". Ex. Clinton's slogan was "It's the economy, stupid" and they primarily focused on that.

- Clinic: skin damage. Lead sentence "Skin damage is like getting older: it accumulates over years and cannot be reversed"

- "Names, names, names" - slogan of a local paper who tried to put as many local people in it as possible. That is how they succeeded, being hyper local.

- Simple = core + compact

- Sentences > paragraphs

- Reading proverbs are really good for making simple ideas with a lot of value in them. Get a book on proverbs?
