# Made to stick by Chip and Dan Heath

- Throughout the book, each section ends with something leading into the next section. Ex. "BLANK is a problem. Silverman came up with a solution" and then goes in to next paragraph. Flows very nicely.

- "a medium sized popcorn contains more artery clogging grease than a bacon egg and cheese breakfast, big mac and fries, and a steak dinner... combined" good shock / wow. Also super visual.

- Some good qualities of stories:

  1. an unexpected danger in a common activity (ex. razer blades in halloween candy)
  2. simple action (ex. examine the kids candy)
  3. vivid concrete images
  4. tap into emotion (fear for Halloween candy, disgust for movie popcorn)

- There is no formula for a sticky idea. But the more of these things you include the higher liklihood of it being sticky.

- Constantly be looking for ideas with natural talent

### Key concepts:

- Simple: proverbs are great (simple and profound)
- Unexpectedness: generate interest and curiosity (ex. popcorn have more grease). You can do this by opening gaps and closing them
- Concrete: full of visuals, concrete images.
- Credibility: statistics don't really work (more ex. later, ex. no stats on economy slowing down. ask people 'are you better off than you were 4 years ago?')
- Emotions: make them feel something. tip: focus on individual not a group (ex. charity works better that way). we are wired to feel things for people, not abstractions.
- Stories: they are like simulators, you can follow along (Storyworthy is a good book for this)

- Tappers and listeners: people tap a rhythm and listeners have to guess. Study at Stanford. The tappers always thought the listeners would understand more than they did. This is the "Curse of Knowledge" you know the answer so you expect others to know it to.

- 89% of award winning ads can be classified by templates (like the ones we are going over). Most related to unexpectedness.

- "All happy families resemble each other, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" - Tolstoy. Same is true in businesses and ads.

### Concept 1: Simple

- "No plan survives contact with the enemy" - common military expression

- Top of every order is: specify plans goal, and desired end-state. Allow improve on the details.

- Figure out the "Commanders Intent" - ask yourself "if we do nothing else during tomorrow's mission, we must \_\_\_\_". Should have a concrete answer.

- Southwest, we are "The LOW cost airline" everything stems from that. Is a framework that helps everyone but allows them to improvise the details.

- Don't bury the lead, first sentence is most important and each sentence after is decreasing importance. This is an "inverted pyramid". Origin of this is Civil War bc military telegraphs could cut off at any moment.

- Exercise: be a wartime reporter before you write put the top idea first

- "If you say three things, you don't say anything". Ex. Clinton's slogan was "It's the economy, stupid" and they primarily focused on that.

- Clinic: skin damage. Lead sentence "Skin damage is like getting older: it accumulates over years and cannot be reversed"

- "Names, names, names" - slogan of a local paper who tried to put as many local people in it as possible. That is how they succeeded, being hyper local.

- Simple = core + compact

- Sentences > paragraphs

- Reading proverbs are really good for making simple ideas with a lot of value in them. Get a book on proverbs?

- When you say 3 things, you say nothing.

- Use "pointers" to concepts. Ex. "JFK" isn't 3 letters, it is a pointer to a person.

- You tap the existing memory terrain of your audience, use what is already there.

- Easier to learn concepts if you tie it to concepts you already know. You associate it with a schema you have. Schema = a collection of generic properties of a concept. Pre-recorded information in your memory.

- Schemas enable simplicity

- An accurate but useless idea is still useless. So don't worry about only using schemas that are perfectly alike. Because that doesn't exist.

- Use analogies = great way to avoid useless accuracy and dodge the Curse of Knowledge

- Ex. Disney calls cast members, they audition for roles, walk around onstage, customers are guests. Etc.. metaphor is useful for Disney employees.

### Concept 2: Unexpected

- The most basic way of getting someones attention is breaking a pattern. Humans adapt to consistent patterns, so breaking it will alert them.

- Brain is designed to be aware of change. Helps us survive.

- Surprise and interest. Surprise gets someones attention.

- We are constantly guessing on what is going to happen. When it goes against what we guess -> that is surprise and it gets our attention. Ex. family trip ad that ended up a car crash for a seatbelt awareness video.

- Brows go up when you are surprised (eyes get bigger, take in more information. evolutionary thing, kinda cool)

- Only use surprise in service to the core message.

- If you want idea to be sticky. Break someones guessing machine and then fix it.

- Process: 1) identify central message (the core) 2) figure out what is counterintuitive about the message 3) communicate message in way that breaks guessing machine

- Nordstrom, make customers happy even at the expense of efficiency. "Nordies" will giftwrap a product bought from Macys. Unexpected.

- Don't bury the lead

- Exercise in journalism class. Gave them all a bunch of information. They started writing a story using Who what where etc... and then he said. The first sentence is "there will be no school next thursday". Don't bury the lead.

- Big numbers don't stick

- Bring things back to tangible. Foreign aid example for how much US spends on it. Instead of $10B a year, it's one soft drink per US person. Feels more tangible.

- Mystery keeps peoples attention

- Create a mystery and invite the reader in. Mysteries create a need for closure.

- Mystery is created from an unexpected journey.

- 1. schema violation (surprise) and then 2) take them on a journey to uncover something. a mystery

- "What will happen next?"

- Curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge. You can do this by highlighting specific knowledge someone is missing.

- You don't care about something until you find out you didn't know about it.

- Start with a puzzle. "Why do people X do Y, we set out to find out why"

- ABC early on wanted more view time. They had to make people care about sports teams they didn't. Strategy: pan over the city, get you in the shoes of the city people maybe unearth some beef they have with the other team. Teach you so then you are invested in the outcome.

- Give people enough context so they start to care

### Concept 3: Concrete

- Concrete images allow things to persist. Ex. proverb about fox with sour grapes. Image in your head that keeps proverb going for 2,500 years.

- Avoid too much abstraction, make it tangible.

- V8 engine is concrete, "high performance" is abstract

- Teach math by explaining concrete concepts that are familiar instead of just numbers.

- People who are novices crave concreteness.

- Memory is like velcro. Your brain has a bunch of loops (like velcro). The more loops your ideas can latch on to, the better they stick.

- Brown Eyes, Blue Eyes. Lesson to make segregation tangible. Divided students one day. Switched the next. Concept of racism made tangible, you feel it and associate the things you experienced (negative) with it. Made the concept of prejudice concrete.

- Engineers vs Manufacturing. Should aim for manufacturing, they deal with concrete things. Engineers deal in abstraction.

- Exercise. Write down white things. Then write down white things in your fridge. If you're like most people you'll get around the same for both. Concreteness mobilizes your brain to focus.

- Think about specific people and personas, not groups of people. Helps you narrow down on what they want.

### Concept 4: Credibility

- We tend to think things will emerge from somewhere. Ex. scientific discovers emerge from Harvard, not Mississippi.

- We believe because our parents or our friends believe. We believe because we've had experiences that led to our beliefs. We believe because of our religious faith. We believe because we trust authorities.

- Authorities are experts or celebrities. Celebrities work because we want to become like them.

- We trust recommendations of people we want to be like.

- Living proof is effective as authority. Ex. you have a person who is proof of what you are talking about.

- Localized details make something acquire credibility.

- Vivid details boost credibility.

- Statistics are good, but make them visual. Ex. to show a bomb dropped a BB bullet into a bucket. Then 1,000 of them. Sensory way to show the statistic (5,000x more explosive)

- Make large number seem meaningful.

- When Cisco had to decide whether to add wireless network for employees. $500 per year. That was if they became 2 minute more productive per day paid for itself.

- Ex. "A deer is more likely to kill you than a shark" to make people less scared of shark attacks. Taps into audiences credibility. They arent scared of deer so this stat shocks them (unexpected)

- "Sinatra Test" - if I can make it here I can make it anywhere

- Show you can do something that is super hard. If you could do that, you could help the person do whatever they need. Source of credibility.

- Where's the beef Wendy's commercial. Huge bun. Take it off, tiny patty. Challenged customers to go to Wendy's to find out. Testable credentials can provide big credibility boost.

- Ronald Reagan "are you better off than 4 years ago" -> testable credentials dig into audience's credibility

### Concept #5: Emotion

- Mother Teresa, "If you look at the mass I will never act. If you look at one you will" focus on specific individuals

- For charity when you focus on one individual always yields more donations then if you focus on the general problem

- ONLY story though is better than story + stats. The stats dilute it in many cases.

- Make people emotional bc then they want to act

- "Anti-authority resentment" - that's an emotion usually resonates with teens/youth. It's about rebellion.

- "isn't about rational decision-marking; it's about rebellion" -> I like this sentence

- Many ideas use piggybacking strategy, associate with emotions that already exist

- People tend to overuse any idea or concept that delivers an emotional kick. Like the word "unique".

- Best way to make people care, associate something they don't care about with something they do.

- Don't tap into the same things, otherwise it loses it's power (like using words like unique)

- Appeal to self-interest, people matter more to themselves.

- People love underdog stories

- "People laughed when I sat down at the piano, but when I started to play" -> underdog

- Try to get self-interest into every headline you write. Huge benefits trivial costs. Ex. "You can laugh at money worries if you follow this simple plan" "give me 5 days to give you a magnetic personality" "the secret of how to be taller" "retire at 55". Emphasize benefits.

- "The most frequent reason for unsuccessful advertising is advertisers who are so full of their own accomplishments that they forget to tell us why we should buy it (ex. the worlds best seed vs what we want which is the worlds best lawn)"

- How do you take this concept without being sleazy though?

- WIIFY - whats in it for you. central aspect of every speech.

- Say "you" not people. Forces you to certain it around who you are talking to and what's in it for them.

- Maslow's hierarchy, transcendence, self-actualization, aesthetic, learning, esteem, belonging, security, physical

- People pursue these in parallel though. Kinda bogus to say you pursue them separately.

- "Self-interest" is usually the physical, security, or esteem layers.

- People usually think they are motivated by the higher ones, and others are motivated by the lower (physical etc...). But we are all actually highly motivated by the higher ones (esteem, learning, belonging).

- Story about army chef, Floyd Lee, in Iraq. "I am not just in charge of food service; I am in charge of morale". He goes for transcendence.

- Group interest can be a better predictor than self interest. You do things that will benefit your group. Like the ads for anti-littering using Texas celebs. Don't mess with texas, people who are like you saying don't litter.

- "Math is like mental weight training" it isn't useful the actual problems but the concepts apply to others and it makes your brain stronger. Like how you don't lift weights so you can pickup a car. Similar analogy.

- Strategies: using associations, appealing to self-interest, appealing to identity (group).

- Ask why three times. "Three Whys". Helps dig down to the core principle or underlying idea.

- Simulations drive employees to emphasize with customers. So do simulations.

### Concept #6: Stories

- People love underdog stories

- People talk shop because people like to talk to others about the things they have in common

- When we hear a story our minds move from room to room. When we hear a story we simulate it. So give someone something to simulate is the key to a good story.

- When we imagine events, we are invoking the same parts of the brain that would actually do the events.

- Jared from subway, his story packs a wallop because it violates our schema (fast food = unhealthy)

- Aristotle believed there were 4 plots (simple tragic, simple fortunate, complex tragic, complex fortunate)

- We'll simplify it to 3: the challenge, the connection, the creativity

- Challenge plot: David vs Goliath. Obstacles seem daunting. Inspire us bc of perseverance and courage.

- Connection plot: "good samaritan" story. People connecting with each other, usually across some barriers (ex. race or class whatever). Relationship that bridges a gap.

- Creativity plot: mental breakthrough. Ernest Shackleton, faced enormous odds in exploration, created a creative solution where whiny complaining people would sleep with him. Minimized negative influencer by his constant presence.

- Always be looking out for good stories.

- Stories focus people on solutions.
