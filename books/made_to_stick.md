# Made to stick by Chip and Dan Heath

- Throughout the book, each section ends with something leading into the next section. Ex. "BLANK is a problem. Silverman came up with a solution" and then goes in to next paragraph. Flows very nicely.

- "a medium sized popcorn contains more artery clogging grease than a bacon egg and cheese breakfast, big mac and fries, and a steak dinner... combined" good shock / wow. Also super visual.

- Some good qualities of stories:

  1. an unexpected danger in a common activity (ex. razer blades in halloween candy)
  2. simple action (ex. examine the kids candy)
  3. vivid concrete images
  4. tap into emotion (fear for Halloween candy, disgust for movie popcorn)

- There is no formula for a sticky idea. But the more of these things you include the higher liklihood of it being sticky.

- Constantly be looking for ideas with natural talent

### Key concepts:

- Simple: proverbs are great (simple and profound)
- Unexpectedness: generate interest and curiosity (ex. popcorn have more grease). You can do this by opening gaps and closing them
- Concrete: full of visuals, concrete images.
- Credibility: statistics don't really work (more ex. later, ex. no stats on economy slowing down. ask people 'are you better off than you were 4 years ago?')
- Emotions: make them feel something. tip: focus on individual not a group (ex. charity works better that way). we are wired to feel things for people, not abstractions.
- Stories: they are like simulators, you can follow along (Storyworthy is a good book for this)

- Tappers and listeners: people tap a rhythm and listeners have to guess. Study at Stanford. The tappers always thought the listeners would understand more than they did. This is the "Curse of Knowledge" you know the answer so you expect others to know it to.

- 89% of award winning ads can be classified by templates (like the ones we are going over). Most related to unexpectedness.

- "All happy families resemble each other, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" - Tolstoy. Same is true in businesses and ads.

### Concept 1: Simple

- "No plan survives contact with the enemy" - common military expression

- Top of every order is: specify plans goal, and desired end-state. Allow improve on the details.

- Figure out the "Commanders Intent" - ask yourself "if we do nothing else during tomorrow's mission, we must \_\_\_\_". Should have a concrete answer.

- Southwest, we are "The LOW cost airline" everything stems from that. Is a framework that helps everyone but allows them to improvise the details.

- Don't bury the lead, first sentence is most important and each sentence after is decreasing importance. This is an "inverted pyramid". Origin of this is Civil War bc military telegraphs could cut off at any moment.

- Exercise: be a wartime reporter before you write put the top idea first

- "If you say three things, you don't say anything". Ex. Clinton's slogan was "It's the economy, stupid" and they primarily focused on that.

- Clinic: skin damage. Lead sentence "Skin damage is like getting older: it accumulates over years and cannot be reversed"

- "Names, names, names" - slogan of a local paper who tried to put as many local people in it as possible. That is how they succeeded, being hyper local.

- Simple = core + compact

- Sentences > paragraphs

- Reading proverbs are really good for making simple ideas with a lot of value in them. Get a book on proverbs?

- When you say 3 things, you say nothing.

- Use "pointers" to concepts. Ex. "JFK" isn't 3 letters, it is a pointer to a person.

- You tap the existing memory terrain of your audience, use what is already there.

- Easier to learn concepts if you tie it to concepts you already know. You associate it with a schema you have. Schema = a collection of generic properties of a concept. Pre-recorded information in your memory.

- Schemas enable simplicity

- An accurate but useless idea is still useless. So don't worry about only using schemas that are perfectly alike. Because that doesn't exist.

- Use analogies = great way to avoid useless accuracy and dodge the Curse of Knowledge

- Ex. Disney calls cast members, they audition for roles, walk around onstage, customers are guests. Etc.. metaphor is useful for Disney employees.

### Concept 2: Unexpected

- The most basic way of getting someones attention is breaking a pattern. Humans adapt to consistent patterns, so breaking it will alert them.

- Brain is designed to be aware of change. Helps us survive.

- Surprise and interest. Surprise gets someones attention.

- We are constantly guessing on what is going to happen. When it goes against what we guess -> that is surprise and it gets our attention. Ex. family trip ad that ended up a car crash for a seatbelt awareness video.

- Brows go up when you are surprised (eyes get bigger, take in more information. evolutionary thing, kinda cool)

- Only use surprise in service to the core message.

- If you want idea to be sticky. Break someones guessing machine and then fix it.

- Process: 1) identify central message (the core) 2) figure out what is counterintuitive about the message 3) communicate message in way that breaks guessing machine

- Nordstrom, make customers happy even at the expense of efficiency. "Nordies" will giftwrap a product bought from Macys. Unexpected.

- Don't bury the lead

- Exercise in journalism class. Gave them all a bunch of information. They started writing a story using Who what where etc... and then he said. The first sentence is "there will be no school next thursday". Don't bury the lead.

- Big numbers don't stick

- Bring things back to tangible. Foreign aid example for how much US spends on it. Instead of $10B a year, it's one soft drink per US person. Feels more tangible.

- Mystery keeps peoples attention

- Create a mystery and invite the reader in. Mysteries create a need for closure.

- Mystery is created from an unexpected journey.

- 1. schema violation (surprise) and then 2) take them on a journey to uncover something. a mystery

- "What will happen next?"

- Curiosity happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge. You can do this by highlighting specific knowledge someone is missing.

- You don't care about something until you find out you didn't know about it.

- Start with a puzzle. "Why do people X do Y, we set out to find out why"

- ABC early on wanted more view time. They had to make people care about sports teams they didn't. Strategy: pan over the city, get you in the shoes of the city people maybe unearth some beef they have with the other team. Teach you so then you are invested in the outcome.

- Give people enough context so they start to care

### Concept 3: TODO:
